# LLM-Powered Workflow for Query Classification and Data Handling

## Introduction

Welcome to the LLM-Powered Workflow project! This is an innovative system designed to make interacting with data both intuitive and powerful. Leveraging the capabilities of language models, this workflow intelligently classifies user queries and provides insightful responses, whether they relate to data retrieval or general inquiries.

## Features

- **Query Classification**: The system accurately identifies whether a user's question is a normal query or related to data retrieval, ensuring tailored responses.
- **Interactive Data Handling**: Users can upload CSV or Excel files, which the system processes and makes ready for analysis.
- **Dynamic Code Generation**: Based on user queries, the assistant can generate executable Python code to manipulate and visualize data.
- **Rich Visualizations**: Using `Plotly`, the workflow creates stunning visual representations of the data, making insights clear and accessible.
